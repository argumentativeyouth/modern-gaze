After the first 15 minutes, I knew I was going to watch this 209 minutes long movie till its end even though it seemed boring.

I am talking about Martin Scorsese’s *The Irishman*.

Based on the life and times of Frank ‘the Irishman’ Sheeran, *The Irishman* is a remarkable movie not for its storyline but for its depiction of the lesser dramatic side of the golden age of American mobs.

Frank (Robert De Niro) met Russel Bufalino (Joe Pesci), the crime boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family or the Bufalino crime family in the 1950s when Frank was still a truck driver. Soon after, Frank joined Russell. *The Irishman* is a movie which shows how Frank climbed the ladder and became one of the top hit man in the gang.

A major part of the film also tells the story of Frank's relationship with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), a powerful Teamster who disappeared mysteriously in 1975. The film, adapted from Charles Brandt’s **I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa** throws light into the disapperance of Hoffa.

Unlike other mobster movies like *The Godfather* trilogy or *Goodfellas*, *The Irishman* isn't a movie that will give you an adrenaline rush. The minimum actions the film depicts are too sluggish and lethargic; afterall, the actors who played the three major roles are in their 70s.

And yet, the film leaves a certain impression in the hearts of its viewers. Violence is an integrated part of mobster movies but *The Irishman* portrays more than just violence. It gives a glimpse of the complicated psyche of mobsters - their emotions, regrets, loyalty, friendship, and the clashes between all these.

*The Irishman* is a more matured movie in the Crime Film genre and Martin Scorsese has done a brilliant job in it.
