After the first 15 minutes, I knew I was going to watch till the end of this 209 minutes long movie even though it seemed boring.

I am talking about Martin Scorsese’s *The Irishman*.

Based on the life and times of Frank ‘the Irishman’ Sheeran, *The Irishman* is a remarkable movie not for its storyline but for its depiction of the lesser dramatic side of the golden age of American mobs.

Frank met Russel Bufalino, the crime boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family or the Bufalino crime family in the 1950s when Frank was still a truck driver. Soon after, Frank joined Russell. The Irishman is a movie which depicts how Frank climbed the ladder and became one of the top hit man in the gang.

A major part of the film also tells the story of Frank's relationship with Jimmy Hoffa, a powerful Teamster. Russel introduces Frank with Jimmy.
