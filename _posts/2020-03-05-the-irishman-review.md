After the first 15 minutes, I knew I was going to watch till the end of this 209 minutes long movie even though it seemed boring.

I am talking about Martin Scorsese’s *The Irishman*.

Based on the life and times of Frank ‘the Irishman’ Sheeran, *The Irishman* is a remarkable movie not for its storyline but for its depiction of the lesser dramatic side of the golden age of American mobs.

Frank met Russel Bufalino, the crime boss of the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family or the Bufalino crime family in the 1950s when Frank was still a truck driver. Soon after, Frank joined Russell. The Irishman is a movie which shows how Frank climbed the ladder and became one of the top hit man in the gang.

A major part of the film also tells the story of Frank's relationship with Jimmy Hoffa, a powerful Teamster who disappeared mysteriously in 1975. Th film, adapted from Charles Brandt’s **I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran & Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa** throws light into the disapperance of Hoffa.

Unlike other mobster movies like *The Godfather* trilogy or *Goodfellas*, *The Irishman* isn't a movie that will make you feel an adrenaline rush. The minimum actions the film depicts are too sluggish and lethargic (afterall,).
