Writing a review for a Salman Rushdie book is a tough task. One does not know where to begin given the way he blends magic and reality with innumerable characters and with plots blooming like wild fire. 

When he lets the jinns free in his latest work of ingenuity “Two Years Eight Months and Twenty Eight Nights”, we are told the story of the crumbling reality of today’s world.

Like his other novels, this one too is a fusion of facts and the imaginary, of history and myth. The story begins with a love affair between the great Aristotelian philosopher, the rationalist Ibn Rushd and a jinnia princess Dunia during the former’s exile which he brought upon himself after challenging the pious theologian Ghazali. Narrated by our descendants, who live on this planet a thousand years from now, the basic storyline revolves around “The War Of The Worlds” which takes place in the present, when the descendents of Ibn Rushd and the jinnia princess have spread throughout the world, forgetting their fairy traces. 

The passages between Peristan - the land of the jinns - and our world, which were sealed for all these years, are affected, and the philosophical feud between the two long-dead scholars begins all over again with “the time of strangenesses” for the people of this world: the connection being the half-magical descendants residing in this world. 

And the strangeness is featured through incidents like a simple gardener Mr Geronimo beginning to levitate one fine day after a mysterious storm and a baby born with the power to detect dishonest dealings. 

The existence of our world is at stake and, at this point, Dunia, the jinnia princess, who Ibn Rushd abandoned when he was accepted back into his world with all respect, and who centuries ago had fallen love with a human, raises an army of her half-magical descendants to save the world. 

The war lasted for two years eight months and twenty eight nights, i.e. a thousand and one nights, as in the ‘Arabian Nights’. 

What makes the novel more interesting is its twofold relation with the contemporary world. 

Salman Rushdie, in his autobiography ‘Joseph Anton’, mentions that his father derived the surname Rushdie from Ibn Rushd of whom he was a great fan. The story reflects the fight Rushdie himself had with the Islamofascism which he encountered first hand when he was issued a fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran who ordered his death. 

Thus, the fight between Ibn Rushd and Ghazali basically reflects the real-lifefight between rationality and religious fundamentalism, although depicted in a magical world. 

The disastrous storm in the novel also reminds us of the climate change our world is going through,which many of our politicians refuse to accept for personal gains, but that doesn’t change the fact these climate changes put life on earth at stake. 

Dunia’s act of raising an army against the forces that put the world into danger also reminds us of the powerful weapon that love is. Dunia not only fell with Ibn Rushd, a human, but all of human kind. Even though she was betrayed in her love, she doesn’t resort to revenge. This reinforces our beliefs and expectations from love in the true sense.

Rushdie has successfully depicted human emotions and situations in the contemporary world in this magical novel. 

Although it deals with serious issues, there is no lack of humor and entertainment in the way he presents his case.
