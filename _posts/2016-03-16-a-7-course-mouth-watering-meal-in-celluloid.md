‘Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what’s for lunch’.

Although I do not know the context in which the American actor, director, and writer, George Orson Welles wrote the aforesaid lines, being a foodie myself, I can guess the sentiments behind it.

He was probably poking fun at everyone with a discerning palate.

Probably he meant that a gluttonous gourmand can give up everything, including his country, for a good meal.

While watching a restaurant scene in a movie, the gourmand might be imagining the food choices of the characters.

Here is a list of seven movies of recent times which are about lip-smacking, delicious food from around the world.

## 1. Eat Drink Man Woman (1994)

This Taiwanese film directed by Ang Lee features the generation gap between three sisters and their traditionalist father.

However the collision between modernity and traditional beliefs is complemented by a glorious banquet Mr Chu (Sihung Lung) makes for his daughters every Sunday – his only way of expressing his love and admiration for his daughters.

## 2. Chocolat (2000)

If you are a chocolate lover (well, who is not?), then this is a mustwatch movie. But beware! You might end up smashing your television set for it cannot help you with smelling or tasting the food.

Vianne (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, who keeps moving from one place to another along with her illegitimate daughter, Anouk, arrives at a small, calm, traditional village and opens a chocolate shop. Because of her way of living and her open-minded nature, Vianne doesn’t fit in. However, her charm and friendliness make her win over the villagers.

This causes the orthodox mayor of the village, who adheres to traditions, to panic and he comes up with various ideas to make the villagers boycott Vianne.

Ultimately he too falls for Vianne’s mouth-watering chocolates. The movie was directed by Lasse Hallstrom.

## 3. Julia And Julia (2009)

This is an inspirational movie directed by Nora Ephron that follows the early years of the life of Chef Julia Child (played by Meryl Streep), and the battles she fought in those initial years while she was learning French cooking and writing a book on that for American housewives.

The film has a parallel storyline featuring a young girl named Julie Powell (Amy Adams), who decides to cook all the recipes mentioned in Julia Child’s book, and document this in a blog.

The film not only inspires budding chefs but also highlights the challenges faced by women while chasing their dreams. 

## 4. Jiro Dreams Of Sushi (2011) 

If you are a connoisseur of Japanese cuisine, especially sushi, then this is a documentary by David Gelb you must watch not only to charge up your taste buds, but also to understand the painstakingly hard work needed to make sushi.

The film documents the life of Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old sushi master who owns a 10-seat, three-star restaurant located in Tokyo that serves sushi at a remarkably low price. 

Jiro Ono devoted his whole life to master and improve the art of making sushi. The film also follows his two sons who inherited their father’s obsession with this Japanese dish.

## 5. The Lunchbox (2013)

Bollywood isn’t left behind when it comes to making movies about food. The Lunchbox, directed by Ritesh Batra, portrays how home-cooked meals could play an important role in developing human relationships.

A mistake by the dabbawalas of Mumbai results in the lunchbox prepared by Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a housewife trying to bring romance back into her married life by cooking delicious food for her busy husband, getting delivered to Saajan Fernandes (Irrfan Khan), a widower about to retire from his job. 

They started sending letters to each other via the lunchbox, and a friendship between two lonely persons is born. 

The story develops into a mature love story, and yes, food loving Indians can relate themselves to it.

## 6. Chef (2014)

Chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) walks out from the restaurant he worked in because the restaurant owner, Riva (Dustin Hoffman) doesn’t want him to experiment with dishes.

He also loses his professional credibility after a fight with a restaurant reviewer. 

He then starts a journey in his food truck to rediscover his passion for food, serving top quality Cuban sandwiches and yucca fries. 

The movie, directed by Jon Favreau, is an inspiration for people who are creative but cannot show their creativity because of workplace constraints or restrictions imposed by the people they work under.

## 7. The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014)

This foodie genre movie directed by Lasse Hallstrom features an Indian family, the Kadam family, which opens an Indian restaurant, the Maison Mumbai, in a French village.

The family buys a property in a French village that is just hundred feet across the street from a French restaurant. 

Although the two owners, Papa Kadam (Om Puri) and Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren), initially have problems with each other, eventually their relationship turns into friendship and love. 

This movie gives an insight into the art of cooking across two different cultures and how they might blend together and improve the culinary arts.
