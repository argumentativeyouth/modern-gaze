**In Other Words by Jhumpa Lahiri**

**Translated by Ann Goldstein**

**Year of Publication: 2016**

**Publisher: Penguin Books India**

Born to Indian immigrants in America, the writer JumpaLahiri has said that she considered herself an incomplete person, in some way deficient. As a Bengali who doesn’t know how to properly read or write the language, and English not being her mother tongue, she cited ‘linguistic reason- the lack of a language to identify with’ for considering herself incomplete and deficient.

And yet, she won a Pulitzer Prize for her first book, Interpreter of Maladies, in 2000. She has written three other authoritative works of fiction: The Namesake, Unaccustomed Earth, and The Lowland, each of which deals with the lives and experiences of Indian immigrants, Bengali to be precise, in the United States. 

She has made her mark in the world of English literature, and yet in 2012, she moved to Rome with her family to learn Italian, a language she fell in love with during her 20s, when she went to Italy for the first time. And she stopped writing in English, the very language that made her.

“In Other Words” is Lahiri’s first work of non-fiction, originally written in Italian, translated by Ann Goldstein. Lahiri didn’t translate her Italian work into English herself because it “was disorienting, frustrating, also discouraging. It made me acutely aware of how limited my Italian was compared with my English.” That shows her dedicated love for Italian, and also the fact that she knows her limitations in her beloved language. And it is evident from the book, the translated one, of course.

Compared to her other works of fiction in English, In Other Words is dull. Lahiri writes about her experiences about the tedious process of learning to read and write in Italian, since the moment she fell in love with the language in her 20s. She writes, in details, about how the process of learning started, from buying a small dictionary, to learning from tutorial books, her experiences with tutors, her failed attempt at writing and conversing in Italian properly, and ultimately moving to Rome, ‘to reach the Italian language’. 

The book is, without any doubt, inspiring and motivating, for people, who want to learn a different language. Language learning, at latter stage of life, isn’t an easy task, and most of the people usually give up, for the same reasons as Lahiri went through during the initial days of her tedious journey of learning Italian.  But that she didn’t give up for more than two decades of her life, and at the end of it, she has actually written a book in Italian, is awe-inspiring. Her devotion to the process of learning language and reach her present position is admirable beyond doubt.

What this book lacks is any literary value. My interpretation of the book is of course limited by my lack of knowledge of the Italian language, but it seemed from Goldstein’s translation of the book that it wasn’t extraordinary from the literary point of view. It lacked the depth, the beautiful style of Lahiri’s expression, the way she depicts emotion as evident in her English works.

There was also very little mention of the Italian life, its culture and people in the book. How can a language be separated from the very culture and people it belongs to? Doesn’t embracing a language, the way Lahiri embraced Italian, requirethe embracing of all that comes with it, the life, culture, and people, for instance? And if Lahiri has done it, embraced every aspect of the Italian world, why is it missing in her work? The book deals only with her inner struggle in the process of learning Italian. And that, actually, limited the scope and possibility of her work.

In Other Words is undoubtedly a great piece of work especially if you consider that it has been written by someone who doesn’t belong to that language, nor grew up in Italy. But at the same time, Lahiri’s position in the world of English literature cannot be ignored. And that she has stopped writing in English to master Italian, and then come up with In Other Wordsis disappointing for her readers.
