According to Hindu Mythology, Ahalya, the most beautiful woman on earth, was the wife of much older Maharishi Gautama. 

Indra, the king of gods, was attracted to her divine beauty. He came to Ahalya in the guise of Maharishi Gautama when Gautama himself was not around. They made love. 

Whether or not Ahalya was aware of the fact that it was actually Indra in disguise is debateable. There are different versions of the story of Ahalya. But in all of them, Maharishi Gautama came to know of all that had transpired. And he cursed both Indra and Ahalya. The curse turned Ahalya into a stone.

Sujoy Ghosh's spooky short film 'Ahalya' challenges the ethics and morality, the right and wrong portrayed in the actual mythical story.

Goutam Sadhu (Soumitra Chatterjee) is a famous artist who creates miniature dolls of real-life people.

Police officer Indra Sen (Tota Roy Chowdhury) visits the house of the artist to inquire about a missing person who was last seen at Sadhu's place. The officer is welcomed by Ahalya, the young wife of the old artist. The police officer is unable to take his eyes off the gorgeous Ahalya.

As Goutam and Indra talks, Ahalya goes upstairs. 

While telling about what could have happened to the missing person, Goutam tells Indra about a magic stone that he possesses which, when touched, can turn a human who touches it to any other human. He says that the missing person might have used it.

To prove it, he lets Goutam to touch the stone and then go upstairs to Ahalya.

Indra, who is clearly attracted to Ahalya, does as he is told. Apparently, the stone works. But whether or not Ahalya is aware of the disguise isn't clear in the film. Nor is it relevant.

The film, after all, challenges the mytical story, in two ways:

One, unlike in the actual story, here, Goutam asks Indra to use the stone and take the guise of Goutam, then go upstairs to his wife.

Second, Ahalya is not punished here. Only Indra is... How? Watch the film.

But that Ahalya is not punished here does not, in no way, mean the film has a feminist angle to it as claimed by [this article](https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/reviews/story/ahalya-sujoy-ghoshs-short-film-is-not-just-about-the-suspense-radhika-apte-soumitra-chatterjee-tota-roy-chowdhury-283967-2015-07-22).

Feminism is about challenging discrimination based on sex. It is about bringing in equality. In all versions of the mythical story, Maharishi Gautama doesn't consider whether or not Ahalya was aware of Indra's disguise. He turns her into a stone. 

If Ahalya really thought it was Maharishi Gautama she had made love with, then the punishment is not justified. 

Well, in a fair world, the punishment wouldn't be justified even if she had indulged in infidelity. After all, it was a match made by Brahma between a young woman and an old man. But that's not in the scope of this article. 

Anyway, Maharishi Gautama didn't consider the possibility that Ahalya herself was a victim.

Sujoy Ghosh's 'Ahalya' challenges this particular aspect of the mythical story. Indira is punished here. Ahalya isn't. 

At the same time, Goutam himself gives Indra the opportunity to engage himself in a physical relationship with his wife. Or should I say he tricked Indra into doing what he did, thus, revealing the grey areas of human morality.
